# AnomalyDetection

Anomaly Detection Using Seasonal Hybrid Extreme Studentized Deviate Test

## Description

A technique for detecting anomalies in seasonal univariate time series.
The methods uses are robust, from a statistical standpoint, in the presence of 
seasonality and an underlying trend. These methods can be used in 
wide variety of contexts. For example, detecting anomalies in system metrics after 
a new software release, user engagement post an 'A/B' test, or for problems in 
econometrics, financial engineering, political and social sciences.

## About This Fork

Twitterfolks launched this package in 2014. Many coding and package standards 
have changed. The package now conforms to CRAN standards.

The plots were nice and all but terribly unnecessary. The two core functions
have been modified to only return tidy data frames (tibbles, actually). This
makes it easier to chain them without having to deal with list element 
dereferencing.

Shorter, snake-case aliases have also been provided:

- `ad_ts` for `AnomalyDetectionTs`
- `ad_vec` for `AnomalyDetectionVec`

The original names are still in the package but the `README` and examples
all use the newer, shorter versions.

The following outstanding PRs from the original repo are included:

- Added in PR [#98](https://github.com/twitter/AnomalyDetection/pull/98/) (@gggodhwani)
- Added in PR [#93](https://github.com/twitter/AnomalyDetection/pull/93) (@nujnimka)
- Added in PR [#69](https://github.com/twitter/AnomalyDetection/pull/69) (@randakar)
- Added in PR [#44](https://github.com/twitter/AnomalyDetection/pull/44) (@nicolasmiller)
- PR [#92](https://github.com/twitter/AnomalyDetection/pull/92) (@caijun) inherently resolved

## What's Inside The Tin

The following functions are implemented:

- `ad_ts`:	Anomaly Detection Using Seasonal Hybrid ESD Test
- `ad_vec`:	Anomaly Detection Using Seasonal Hybrid ESD Test

## How the package works

The underlying algorithm – referred to as Seasonal Hybrid ESD (S-H-ESD) builds
upon the Generalized ESD test for detecting anomalies. Note that S-H-ESD can
be used to detect both global as well as local anomalies. This is achieved by
employing time series decomposition and using robust statistical metrics, viz.,
median together with ESD. In addition, for long time series (say, 6 months of
minutely data), the algorithm employs piecewise approximation - this is rooted
to the fact that trend extraction in the presence of anomalies in non-trivial -
for anomaly detection.

Besides time series, the package can also be used to detect anomalies in a
vector of numerical values. We have found this very useful as many times the
corresponding timestamps are not available. The package provides rich
visualization support. The user can specify the direction of anomalies, the
window of interest (such as last day, last hour), enable/disable piecewise
approximation; additionally, the x- and y-axis are annotated in a way to assist
visual data analysis.

## Installation

You can install AnomalyDetection from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hrbrmstr/AnomalyDetection")
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, include=FALSE}
options(width=120)
```

## How to get started

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(AnomalyDetection)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
data(raw_data)

res <- ad_ts(raw_data, max_anoms=0.02, direction='both')

glimpse(res)

# for ggplot2
raw_data$timestamp <- as.POSIXct(raw_data$timestamp)

ggplot() +
  geom_line(
    data=raw_data, aes(timestamp, count), 
    size=0.125, color="lightslategray"
  )  +
  geom_point(
    data=res, aes(timestamp, anoms), color="#cb181d", alpha=1/3
  ) +
  scale_x_datetime(date_labels="%b\n%Y") +
  scale_y_comma() +
  theme_ipsum_rc(grid="XY")
```

From the plot, we observe that the input time series experiences both positive 
and negative anomalies. Furthermore, many of the anomalies in the time series
are local anomalies within the bounds of the time series’ seasonality (hence,
cannot be detected using the traditional approaches). The anomalies detected
using the proposed technique are annotated on the plot. In case the timestamps 
for the plot above were not available, anomaly detection could then carried 
out using the AnomalyDetectionVec function; specifically, one can use the 
`AnomalyDetectionVec()` method. The equivalent call to the above would be:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ad_vec(raw_data[,2], max_anoms=0.02, period=1440, direction='both')
```

Often, anomaly detection is carried out on a periodic basis. For instance, at
times, one may be interested in determining whether there was any anomaly
yesterday. To this end, we support a flag only_last whereby one can subset the
anomalies that occurred during the last day or last hour.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
data(raw_data)

res <- ad_ts(raw_data, max_anoms=0.02, direction='both', only_last="day")

glimpse(res)

# for ggplot2
raw_data$timestamp <- as.POSIXct(raw_data$timestamp)

ggplot() +
  geom_line(
    data=raw_data, aes(timestamp, count), 
    size=0.125, color="lightslategray"
  )  +
  geom_point(
    data=res, aes(timestamp, anoms), color="#cb181d", alpha=1/3
  ) +
  scale_x_datetime(date_labels="%b\n%Y") +
  scale_y_comma() +
  theme_ipsum_rc(grid="XY")
```

Anomaly detection for long duration time series can be carried out by setting
the longterm argument to `TRUE`.
